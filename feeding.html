    Last night, my manager asked my male counterpart to present sections of the deliverable that we both worked in while we were on a conference call with the client.  I worked on half of the deliverable but I wasn't asked to contribute.  I feel slighted.  Should I bring this up to my manager?

    My male co-worker was asked to present sections of the deliverable that we both worked on during a conference call with a client.  I worked on a large portion of the deliverable and wasn't asked to present or answer questions about my sections when they came up.  I have client-facing experience so I felt slighted.  Should I tell my manager how I feel about this?

  <div class="question">
    One of my female co-workers is frustrated because an internal stakeholder is condescending and rude to her in email.  When she raised the issue with our first line manager, he said “that is how it is here.  It’s always been this way.  if you don’t like it, leave”.  This makes me wonder whether I am better off looking for a different job.  Is there anything I can do?
